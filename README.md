# Bitcoin-Halving-Countdown






⏳ Bitcoin Halving Countdown

A simple single-page website that displays the remaining time until the next Bitcoin halving event. Bitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and reduces the block reward by half, cutting the rate at which new Bitcoin enters the network.

This mechanism lowers miner revenue, but at the same time reduces Bitcoin inflation. As fewer new coins are produced, Bitcoin becomes scarcer, which historically has contributed to increasing its long-term value.
